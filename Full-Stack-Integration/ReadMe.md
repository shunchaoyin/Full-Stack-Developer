# Module 1: Connecting Front-End and Back-End Components
## Learning Objectives
Describe the components and architecture of full-stack development
Explain the steps to set up a full-stack development environment
Describe how to build RESTful APIs for front-end integration
Explain the process of creating and consuming APIs in front-end applications
Identify real-world scenarios for Integrating front-end and back-end components

## Architectural Patterns in Full-Stack Development
- Client-Server Model: Separates the front-end (client) and back-end (server), ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates.

- MVC (Model-View-Controller): Divides applications into three components—Model (data and logic), View (UI), and Controller (input handling)—to simplify development and scaling.

- Monolithic Architecture: Combines front-end, back-end, and logic in a single project, suitable for small applications but challenging to scale.

- Microservices: Decomposes applications into independent services, each handling a specific function and communicating via APIs, ideal for complex, scalable systems.

```C++
dotnet new blazorwasm -o FrontEndApp

dotnet new webapi -o ServerApi
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

dotnet new sln -o FullStackSolution
dotnet sln add FrontEndApp
dotnet sln add ServerApi

Install the required VS Code extensions:

C# Dev Kit: For enhanced C# support.

REST Client: For making HTTP requests directly in VS Code.

CSharpier: For automatic code formatting.
```


## Creating APIs 

Define Front-End Needs: Determine the data the front end will require to display and interact with components efficiently.

Define Endpoints: Create specific URLs for API requests and responses, tailored to different data requirements.

Structure Responses: Format responses in JSON with consistent structures to ensure compatibility and efficient data transfer.

Implement CORS: Enable secure data sharing between front-end and back-end on different domains, restricting requests to trusted sources.

# Module 2: Consuming APIs in Blazor Applications

Setup HttpClient: Use Blazor's HttpClient to configure and send API requests.

Make API Calls: Implement GET requests to fetch data from APIs dynamically.

Bind Data to Components: Dynamically render API data in Blazor components for real-time UI updates.

Error Handling: Use try-catch blocks to manage errors gracefully during API interactions.

## Performance Best Practices
### 1. Caching API Responses
- Store frequently accessed data locally to avoid redundant requests and reduce server load.

- Techniques include utilizing in-memory caches or browser storage mechanisms (e.g., localStorage in Blazor).

- Example: Cache static data like product categories or weather forecasts, refreshing the cache at defined intervals to ensure accuracy.

### 2. Pagination
 - Break large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks, limiting data transfer per request to improve application responsiveness and save bandwidth.

- Implementation can involve using data grids or infinite scrolling to load content dynamically.

- Example: For a reviews page, load ten entries initially and enable the "Load More" functionality for subsequent pages.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Enforce controls on the number of requests sent to the server within a specified timeframe, mitigating server strain.

- Use client-side logic or APIs' rate-limiting headers to implement delays or notify users when limits are reached.

- Example: Queue requests for profile image updates to avoid hitting API rate thresholds.

## Concurrency vs. Parallelism

Concurrency: Handles multiple tasks by switching between them without simultaneous execution.

Parallelism: Executes multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging multiple processors for faster processing.
